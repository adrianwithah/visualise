# visualise
Visualisation of concepts in 3D space using Augmented Reality

# Visualisations available
- Linear Algebra

# Installation
***Currently only tested for Android***

Transfer Visualise.apk file into Android device. Opening the file will lead to installation of the app.

# Usage

Open App. Once Camera feed is activated, point the camera at one of the recognizable markers such as the one below.

A 3D grid will be displayed above the marker. Input parameters to display vectors/spans/nullspaces/solutions.
